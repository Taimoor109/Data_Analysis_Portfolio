# Taimoor Akhtar - Data_Analysis_Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Taimoor! I have an analytical background in Business and Computer Science. Currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MS. Data Science). I have developed a strong foundation in hypothesis testing and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my courses, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Taimoor%20Akhtar-Resume.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in projects I have done under Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The Advanced Data Analytics program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recommend you install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn these basic libraries.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Yellow Taxi Trip Data Analysis
**Code:** [`Automatidata Projec Inspect and analyze data (1).ipynb`](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/inspect%20and%20analyze%20data/Automatidata%20Projec%20Inspect%20and%20analyze%20data%20(1).ipynb)    
**The purpose:** of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided.

**The goal:** is to use a dataframe contructed within Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform team members of your findings.   
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** After looking at the dataset, the two variables that are most likely to help build a predictive model for taxi ride fares are total_amount and trip_distance because those variables show a picture of a taxi cab ride.  

### EDA and visualization of New York City TLC's data
**Code:** [`final_project.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/blob/main/37_final_project/final_project.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`my_project_slides.pdf`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/blob/main/37_final_project/my_project_slides.pdf)   
**Description:** The final project for 5 month Data Analysis Course. Setup: you're employed in a mobile games development company. A Product Manager gives you following tasks: to find and visualize retention, to make a decision based on the A/B test data, to suggest a number of metrics to evaluate the results of the last monthly campaign.   
**Skills:** data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, proportions z-test, bootstrapping, defining metrics.    
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats, Bootstrap.     
**Results:** python functions to calculate and plot users retention, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result with a recommendation to push tested in-app changes into production, a set of metrics to evaluate success of promotion campaign.  

### A Landing Page Design Experiment
**Code:** [`notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/4_career_factory/notebook.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`slides.pdf`](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/4_career_factory/slides.pdf)    
**Description:** My solution to an open Data Analyst competition held by [Карьерный Цех](https://careerfactory.ru/). The solution took the 7th place in the competition (≈100 solutions were submitted by participants).     
**Skills:** evaluating A/B-test design, data cleaning, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, calculating conversion rate, calculating bounce rate, log-scale transformations, Shapiro–Wilk test of distribution normality, A/B-tests (proportions z-test, Mann–Whitney rank test), plotting results, making conclusion and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.      
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats.   
**Results:** A/B test design analysis, conclusion on rolling the new landing page design to production, recommendations on how to improve. 


### ab testing course by google
**Description:** A/B Testing Course by Google. [The course official page](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257?autoenroll=true).  
This 1 month course covers how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power, how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having my notes and useful links on A/B testing based on the course lectures, tasks and materials ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/ab_testing_by_google_udacity)  
**Status:** Completed in February 2023 (please, check the certificates section below).  


### Tableau Vizzes
**Description:** My Tableau Public account ---> [go to Tableau..](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nktn.lx#!/)  
**Status:** ∞  

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
- [Algorithms Training 3.0 by Yandex](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQ5p0F_acNAXgnKBhgGhxLl-8W6HlCid/view?usp=sharing) (Apr 2023) (Yandex)
