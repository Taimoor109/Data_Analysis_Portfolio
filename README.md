## About
Hi, I'm Taimoor! with analytical background, I have developed a strong foundation in hypothesis testing and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data specialist.

During my courses, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

My CV is in [pdf](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Taimoor%20Akhtar%20Resume.pdf).

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recommend you install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn these basic libraries.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Yellow Taxi Trip Data Analysis
**Code:** [`Automatidata Projec Inspect and analyze data (1).ipynb`](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/inspect%20and%20analyze%20data/Automatidata%20Projec%20Inspect%20and%20analyze%20data%20(1).ipynb)    
**The purpose:** of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided.

**The goal:** is to use a dataframe contructed within Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform team members of your findings.   
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** After looking at the dataset, the two variables that are most likely to help build a predictive model for taxi ride fares are total_amount and trip_distance because those variables show a picture of a taxi cab ride.  

### EDA and visualization of New York City TLC's data
**Code:** [`Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/exploratory%20data%20analysis%20(EDA)/EDA%20and%20data%20visualization%20of%20New%20York%20City%20TLC%20data.ipynb)    
**Presentation:** [`my_project_slides.pdf`](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/exploratory%20data%20analysis%20(EDA)/EDA%20and%20data%20visualization%20of%20New%20York%20City%20TLC%20data.pdf)   
**Tableau Visualization:**['Data visualization'](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/exploratory%20data%20analysis%20(EDA)/Tableau%20viz.png)

**The goal** is to clean data set and create a visualization.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, and data transforms.    
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats.     
**Results:** python functions to calculate and plot users retention, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant results with a recommendation to push tested in-app changes into production, and a set of metrics to evaluate the success of the promotion campaign.  

### A/B Testing
**Code:** [`notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/hypothesis%20testing/AB%20testing.py)    
**Presentation:** [`slides.pdf`](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/hypothesis%20testing/AB%20testing.pdf)    
**The goal** is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.     
**Skills:** evaluating A/B-test design, data cleaning, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, plotting results, making conclusion and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.      
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats.   
**Results:** This project requires an assumption that passengers were forced to pay one way or the other, and that once informed of this requirement, they always complied with it. The data was not collected this way; so, an assumption had to be made to randomly group data entries to perform an A/B test. This dataset does not account for other likely explanations. For example, riders might not carry lots of cash, so it's easier to pay for longer/farther trips with a credit card. In other words, it's far more likely that fare amount determines payment type, rather than vice versa. The difference between average card payment fare and cash fare is inflated, because we use the total amount as the comparing variable. But cash fares all have tip values of $0, while card payments have non-zero values. A possible reason for this occurance is because cash tips aren't declared. In turn, this means that we capture tips in one group but not in the other. Instead, one could compare the `fare_amount` column. 


## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have ( with the date of completion in brackets):
