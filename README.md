# Data_Analysis_Portfolio
Hi, I'm Taimoor! I have an analytical background in Business and Computer Science. Currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MS. Data Science). I have developed a strong foundation in hypothesis testing and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my courses, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/tiannaparris/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Tianna%20Parris%20CV.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The Advanced Data Analytics program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.
